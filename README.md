# truck-loading-optimization

This project aims to solve the **truck loading optimization problem**, ensuring the efficient allocation of goods to trucks based on physical, weight, and volume constraints. The solution leverages a custom algorithm designed to address the problem as a **Linear Programming (LP) model** with unique enhancements tailored to specific business requirements.

The approach guarantees:
- Optimal use of truck capacity.
- Adherence to constraints such as weight distribution, refrigeration, and fragility.
- Scalability to handle various truck and item configurations.

This solution is entirely custom-built, with no reliance on external optimization libraries or frameworks.
